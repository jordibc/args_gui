Generate a web page from the parser object of Python's argparse.

This is basically a placeholder for something I would like to do.

Ideally, I'd like to pick any program that uses argparse and generate
automatically a web page with a nice gui that shows all the
options. Also, from that gui, I'd like to be able to select any option
and get the corresponding command line.
